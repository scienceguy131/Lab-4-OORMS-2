title OORMS:\nSequence Diagram #3\n"Mark as served" from "Cooked" state
actor Cook as cook

participant "view :\n KitchenView" as view
participant "controller :\n KitchenController" as controller
participant "this_order :\n OrderItem" as this_order
'participant "status :\n Status" as status


cook -> view : [Mark as served] button pressed
view -> controller : button_pressed(this_order)
controller -> this_order : advance_status()

this_order --> ":Status" **:\n int(status) + 1
":Status" -> this_order : status = "SERVED"

controller -> view  : create_kitchen_order_ui()

note left
    Unlike the previous diagram, since
    this is the last state for an order
    when view is recreated this time
    the served item will not be seen
    in the kitchen view
end note
