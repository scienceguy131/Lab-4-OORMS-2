title OORMS:\nSequence Diagram #4\n"Mark as served" from COOKED state
actor Cook as cook

participant "view :\n KitchenView" as view
participant "restaurant :\nRestaurant" as restaurant
participant "controller :\n KitchenController" as controller
participant "this_order :\n OrderItem" as this_order
'participant "status :\n Status" as status


cook -> view : [Mark as served] button pressed
view -> controller : button_pressed(this_order)
controller -> this_order : advance_status()

this_order --> ":Status" **:\n int(status) + 1
":Status" -> this_order : status = SERVED

controller -> restaurant : notify_views()

note left
    Unlike in sequence diagram #3, since
    SERVED is the last state for an order,
    when view is recreated the served
    item will not be seen in the kitchen view.
end note
