    Description:
        This is the main module to the OORMS Lab 4 assignment from the EEE320 Object Oriented Analysis class.

    Task:
        P1 - To draw the sequence diagrams of specific sequences of the system as detailed in the lab instructions
        P2 - Actually doing some implementation and coding of the new desired functionalities :))


    Lab Started: October 7, 2022
    Lab Members: OCdt Al-Ansar Mohammed, OCdt Liethan Velasco.


    Notes:
          1 - damn, the code in this lab is simply another iteration of the same code from lab 3. And guess what?
          I commented the hell out of lab 3 explaining the back end xD and you bet I'm gonna migrate the same
          comments into the code for this lab. Of course, not everything will be exact, but of course it'll be a
          great help indeed

          2 - We ultimately chose to use the enum.IntEnum class for our enumerated constants, since it allows us to access the
          values of our status constants with int(Status.this_status). This way it doesn't give us a warning unlike
          using Status.this_status.value with the regular enum.Enum
            a - Strange. I noticed we don't need to import the enumerated status class from model.py/Status in order
            to use its enumerated constants within any other module.

          3 - Huh I think I figured out what this extra argument stuff does. It essentially ensures that each handler
          created for a given object actually gets set to said object. For example, when creating the tables in the
          restaurant view, well we have to make sure that when we touch a certain table, its handler opens up the
          table interface for the table touched. That's what passing that extra argument of table_number which is
          set to the current iterated value of ix into the table's handler is for. Without it, if we were just to
          pass ix into the handler function (the dummy var looping through each table as they get drawn onto the canvas)
          it results in all the handlers intended for each table getting associated with the last iterated through
          table. Just like that pre-added comment, using the extra arg table_number captures the current value of ix
          so that it gets associated with its intended table (lol I just said that twice). Now we know.

          4 - Well I know it's written in the lab instructions, but I'm just going to re-iterate here how we're
          going to implement the status functionality of the items placed. First of all, here's the progression of the
          statuses:

          REQUESTED -> PLACED -> COOKED -> READY -> SERVED.

          The status is set to REQUESTED when the button of an order item is pressed, however has not yet been placed
          (we know it's not placed since the circle to the left of the item's name is white). Here, the item can still
          be cancelled.

          The status thus becomes PLACED when the place order button is pressed, and its associated circle turns green.
          Additionally, the item then gets added to the KitchenView window with a button next to it saying
          "start cooking". The item can still be cancelled here.

          The status of an item becomes COOKED when the "start cooking" button is pressed. The item can no longer be
          cancelled. The button then reads "Mark as ready".

          The status of an item turns READY when the "Mark as Ready" button is pressed. The button then reads
          "Mark as Served".

          The status of an item turns SERVED when the "Mark as Served" button is pressed. Once this happens, the
          item in question is then removed from the KitchenView, simulating that it has left the kitchen and has
          been served to the customer who has ordered it.


          As previously mentioned, these status' were implemented using IntEnum constants, where REQUESTED is -1,
          PLACED is 0, up until SERVED is 3. Doing so also provides the ability to easily set the button text of a
          certain item, by storing the text in an array where the corresponding text of each status is placed at
          the the respective indices (ie. "Mark as Served" at button_text[int(Status.COOKED)] ). It also allows more
          far more elegant methods of status comparisons among a few of the class methods.
