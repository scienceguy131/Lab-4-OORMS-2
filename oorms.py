"""
    Description:
        This is the main module to the OORMS Lab 4 assignment from the EEE320 Object Oriented Analysis class.

    Task:
        P1 - To draw the sequence diagrams of specific sequences of the system as detailed in the lab instructions
        P2 - Actually doing some implementation and coding of the new desired functionalities :))


    Lab Started: October 7, 2022
    Lab Members: OCdt Al-Ansar Mohammed, OCdt Liethan Velasco.


    Notes:
          - damn, the code in this lab is simply another iteration of the same code from lab 3. And guess what?
          I commented the hell out of lab 3 explaining the back end xD and you bet I'm gonna migrate the same
          comments into the code for this lab. Of course, not everything will be exact, but of course it'll be a
          great help indeed



    Status:
        - Velasco and Mohammed (October 7, 2022) COMPLETED - ish: worked on the warmup of part 1
        - Velasco (October 12, 2022): Beginning comment migration from lab 3 into code here
